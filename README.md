Project Overview
Farmart is an e-commerce platform connecting Kenyan farmers directly with buyers, eliminating brokers to ensure better prices for farmers and affordability for buyers.

Problem Statement
Intermediary Dependence: Farmers must depend on brokers, who take significant cuts from their profits.
Inflated Prices: Buyers face higher costs due to the addition of broker fees.
Market Access: Farmers struggle with restricted access to a broader market, limiting their sales opportunities.
Lack of Transparency: Limited visibility into pricing and transaction processes reduces trust among parties involved.
Solution Statement
Direct Market Access: Farmart enables farmers to list and sell their livestock directly to buyers, removing intermediaries and allowing farmers to retain more of their profits.
Fair Pricing: By facilitating direct transactions, Farmart ensures buyers pay fair market prices without inflated broker fees, making livestock more affordable.
Market Expansion: With an easy-to-use interface accessible through the website, Farmart expands market access for farmers, connecting them with a larger pool of buyers.
Transparent Transactions: By leveraging technology to streamline the livestock trade, Farmart aims to empower farmers, offer better prices to buyers, and foster a more sustainable and transparent agricultural sector in Kenya.
